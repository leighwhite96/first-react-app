# React App Experiment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This is the first React app I have created and is an attempt to understand the fundamentals of React such as creating components. 

If you want to run this project, copy the link to this project to your clipboard and run 

```
git clone <url>
```
in the console. Then run 
```
npm install
```
to install the project's dependencies. Finally to launch the app 
```
npm start
```
